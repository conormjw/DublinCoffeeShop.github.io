            <p class="subtitle">About Us</p>
            <p class="description">We are currently open 4 days a week (Wednesday – Saturday) as a shop and take away café. The shop stocks produce from local farms and food producers as well as staples and essentials from further afield with a large selection of natural wines, fresh baked daily sourdough and in house made fermented foods. Currently, we are offering a selection made up of daily-changing sandwiches, salads, arancini and soup/lentils.</p>
			<p class="description">Our coffee is made with beans from Cloud Picker Coffee Roasters, a Dublin-based roastery who ethically source their beans from Bolivia. You can enjoy the best coffee in Dublin while supporting local businesses and Bolivian Coffee Farmers.</p>
            
            <p class="description">REST ASSURED, ALONGSIDE OUR REGULAR HIGH SPEC HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY POLICY, WE HAVE A SAFETY PLAN IN PLACE SPECIFIC TO COVID-19. WE ARE TAKING EVERY PRECAUTION TO MAKE SURE WE AND YOU ARE SAFE. YOUR PATIENCE IS APPRECIATED.</p>
